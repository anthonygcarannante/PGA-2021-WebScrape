# PGA-2021-WebScrape

This repository is an individual web scrape and ETL project. I wanted to pull professional golfer statistics for 2021 season. This was a pretty straigthforward scrape. It primarily required Pandas to pull the statistics from the HTML tables and store them into Pandas DataFrames.

Technologies Used: Pandas, BeautifulSoup, HTML
